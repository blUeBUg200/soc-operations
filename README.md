# The SFM Model

SFM consists of 5 stages to build a new SOC and 4 stages to asses your exisiting SOC.

### Infancy.M1 
SOC monitoring scope (such as only production, production + development, production + development + disaster recovery) based on business requirement

### Infancy.M2
Procurement of SOC tools with high Return of Investment (such as Security Information & Event Management, Endpoint Detection & Response, Network Detection  & Response)
- Mode of SOC operation (In-House or Managed Security Service Provider)

SOC will perform Crown Jewel Analysis (CJA) to identify business critical assets whose compromise might disrupt the business mission.
 

SFM model was designed based on my understanding of SOC and the requirements it should full-fill to combat cyber threats. Feel free to reach me through email (kaviarasan1195@gmail.com) for queries and feedback.
