# Security Operation Centre Functional Model (SFM)

SOC Functional Model (SFM) helps an organization to plan & prepare setting up an new SOC or to asses your exisitng SOC capabilities and identify the areas to focus.

Requesting the audience to have basic understanding of below topics before jumping into the described process for better understanding,

# The SFM Model

SFM consists of 5 stages to build a new SOC and 4 stages to asses your exisiting SOC.

## Infancy
This stage applies only for organizations who are planning to setup Security Operation Centre (SOC) for first time. Below aspects can be decided during the process of planning

<img width="914" alt="Infancy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86832373/175763326-1c7d0d1c-6e8e-46d9-9306-ce78d68e1e5e.png">


### Infancy.M1 - Monitoring Scope
SOC monitoring scope (such as only production, production + development, production + development + disaster recovery) based on business requirement

### Infancy.M2 - Tools Procurement
Procurement of SOC tools with high Return of Investment (such as Security Information & Event Management, Endpoint Detection & Response, Network Detection  & Response)

### Infancy.M3 - Mode of Operation
Mode of SOC operation to be decided such as In-House or Managed Security Service Provider(MssP)

## Age I
This stage is about understanding the environment, business and assets which are of high value target for an attacker.

### Age:I.M1 - Crown Jewel Analysis
- Understand Mission Priorities
    - Understand the business focus and its missions
    - Identify relevant assets which drive the mission's success
- Identify Mission Dependencies
    - Identify dependencies for the mission critical assets
 
### Age:I.M2 - Log Quality Analysis
The integrated device logs should be analyzed on the below perspectives to ensure it adds value to our security monitoring,

- Device Completeness
- Data Field Completeness
- Timeliness
- Consistency
- Retention

more details on the above topics can be found [here](https://github.com/blUeBUg200/bluenightingale#pick-a-mitre-data-source) 

### Age:I.M3 - Primary Analytics
In this stage we will build our first set of usecases to detect anomalies around our crown jewel assets. The usecases might include but not restricted to below,

- Internet to Intranet (and vice-versa) connection on suspicious ports such as 445, 3389, 22, etc.,
- VPN connections from non-business countries
- Brute Force Login Attempts
- Phishing email
- Intranet Port Scanning

> Age:I.M3 might produce high False Positive alerts if we haven't understood the environment better (both N-->S and E-->W traffic behavior to be gathered and excluded as part of known behaviors)

## Age II
This stage is more of an intelligence driven approach to detect, alert and degrade attackers actions against an environment.

### Age:II.M1 - Threat Modeling
In this stage we will gather the list of adversaries who might be interested against your crown jewel assets. The adversaries might land in your environment based on below factors,

- Industry
- Available Technology
- Geographical Location
- Targetted

For more details on threat modeling refer [Threat Modeling](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-modeling/)

### Age:II.M2 - Intelligence driven Analytics
From the previous stage (Age:II.M1) output we have compiled a threat model and it contains below threat groups,
- APT 29 [Matrix](https://github.com/blUeBUg200/soc-operations/blob/main/APT29.svg)
- APT 30 [Matrix](https://github.com/blUeBUg200/soc-operations/blob/main/APT30.svg)

The combination of TTP for both the threat groups can be compiled with the help of MITRE Navigator and the output will look something like [this](https://github.com/blUeBUg200/soc-operations/blob/main/APT_Combined.svg)

No we have list of TTPs for which we need to create detection usecases. There are plenty of resources which will help building the usecase repositiory. Listing few sites for reference,

- [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules)

### Age:II.M3 - Risk Remediation Analysis

During this stage we will analyze the list of security controls which will be useful in defending against the adversary TTPs that we care about. Upon research, I found MITRE Engenuity [security-stack-mapping](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/security-stack-mappings) for Azure and AWS. However, this is still a research topic for me wherein I looking for something more similar to Engenuity project for on-premise IT environment. If you know any references, kindly share your inputs through my email ID listed at the end of the page.



SFM model was designed based on my understanding of SOC and the requirements it should full-fill to combat cyber threats. Feel free to reach me through email (kaviarasan1195@gmail.com) for queries and feedback.
